# Introduction

The goal is to be able to model the most important facets of arbitrary business relationships.  We achieve this by combining a well known conceptual framework with a fairly simple file-based modeling technique.

The conceptual framework is based on the [Six W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws).  This general approach has been used in journalism for many years.

The reason why the framework has relevance to journalism is the same reason why we want to use it for describing contracts.  People need to be able to review contracts *with the same mindset and time frame* that they use when they read a newspaper.  In this sense, summary level information is important.  Predictable conventions for presenting information in a hierarchal manner are essential to readers and participants.

Contracts and newspaper articles are alike, in that the *who, what, where, when, why, and how* of each should be briefly stated.

The Scarsdale library provides a way to model, validate, and present contracts.  Goals:

- simplicity of modeling approach
- value breadth of applicability over depth in any specific problem domain
- support contract rendering and visualization
- support higher level analysis and modeling
