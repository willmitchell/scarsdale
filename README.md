# Introduction

The goal is to be able to model the most important facets of arbitrary business relationships.  We achieve this by combining a well known conceptual framework with a fairly simple file-based modeling technique.

The conceptual framework is based on the [Six W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws).  This general approach has been used in journalism for many years (according to the Wikipedia link and my own experience).

The reason why the framework has relevance to journalism is the same reason why we want to use it for describing Business Relationships (BR).  People need to be able to review BRs (or their associated contracts) *with the same mindset and time frame* that they use when they read a newspaper.  In this sense, summary level information is important.  Predictable conventions for presenting information in a hierarchal manner are essential to readers and participants.

BR's and newspaper articles are alike, in that the *who, what, where, when, why, and how* of each should be briefly stated.  

The Equia Core Library (ECL) provides a way to model, validate, and present BRs.  Goals:

- simplicity of modeling approach
- value breadth of applicability over depth in any specific problem domain
- support BR rendering and visualization
- support higher level analysis and modeling

# Modeling

- V 0.1 of the BR

# Scope (Where can it be used?) 

Currently, you can use BRDL to model the following:

- simple contracts (aka business relationships), like 'pizza', 'beer', and 'phone'
- simple modules, such as 'core'
- real world BR's
- virtual world BR's
- future hybrid (real+virtual) world BR's


# Rendering

# Higher Level Analysis

This library is intended to support higher level tools and frameworks.  Such tools would likely offer the following facilities:

- matching buyers and sellers
- pricing analysis (component, contract, provider)
- planning
- cloud provider mapping
- real world mapping (validation, sponsorship, adoption by state-level actors)
- drive capital formation to real world adopters
